This is the solution for the Final Exam.
Each problem is contain on a package inside 
src/ where every code and document part of 
the discussion has been added. 

Not all of the answer are code and of course not
all of them have been done in the same language 
to ease that problem i have maked the project a 
Python Project and treated everything inside except 
for the c implementation of the openmp as a python project 

Contains :
  1. Src/Problem1 :
    Solution in code and readme with some explenations
  
  2. Src/Problem2 & 3 :
    Been both problems where so related between themselves 
    i did both answer and added them in a pdf each and  of course a readme 
    to explain a bit more what they are and the nature of them
  
  3. Src/Problem 4 :
    This is the art_pic implementation
    with some test images to of course test the main function an 
    see for the results
  
  4. Src/Problem 5:
    This is the most complex package because :
    1. it is a C project since the way to implement the omp 
    librry and functions was through C libraries. 
    
    2. the discussion File wich contains the discusion of the 
      result given by the implementations and the graphs are there too 
      as reference to the discussion.
