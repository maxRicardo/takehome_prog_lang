pdf named as the package. Inside the pdf the first 2 pages are 1 the 
FA that solves the problem of detecting if the decimal number entered is
an Even number or not, and the next page contains the FA that detects decimal 
numbers that can be divided by 3.

are at the end of the image with their respective legend for the agrupation variables.
